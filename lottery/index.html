    <h1>What I Learned About Philadelphia</h1>
    <h2>"What if Philadelphians felt less of a need to play the lotto?"</h2>
    <div>
      <p>I've been living in Philadelphia for about a year and a half, and sometimes I
      feel the urge to walk into a 7-11 or a Wawa to purchase a lotto ticket. For whatever reason,
      I think I've felt that urge more often here than most other places I've lived, even
      though I know that a lotto ticket is a bad buy. (If it wasn't, there wouldn't
      be a lotto!)</p>
      <p>What if I could give Philadelphians a way to experience playing the lotto, without
      wasting their money, in what is one of America's poorest large cities? Enter this
      chapter of our website, "What I Learned About Philadelphia." Below is a lotto
      simulator based loosely on the Pennsylvania Lottery's Match 6 game. The rules
      aren't exactly the same, but they are close.</p>
      <p>Give it a try: click a button, and
      simulate playing a real life-similar lotto game as if you had millions of dollars
      to spend on tickets.</p>
    </p>Unlike the real lottery, when you're done playing this simulator, you'll <em>still</em> have your money
      safely tucked away in your pocket.</p>
